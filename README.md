# Different Types of Parallax Website Templates
These are some templates which I learnt to build through some amazing YouTube videos

[**_DesignCourse_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxm6EwvQIl8 "DesignCourse"): This uses pure Vanilla JS and makes a scrolling effect of elements and not the whole screen

[**_Filip_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLrLJQBG_qo "Filip"): This uses only HTML and SCSS and makes a scrolling effect for the whole screen and a 3D effect

[**_DevEd_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt70Ld0dJCM&t=48s "DevEd"): This uses a variety of JS libraries and makes the image scrolling effect with that fade-in thing for elements, I am yet to complete this.
